# NPC-Generator

## Highlights

- The NPC Generator generates 10 NPCs, each with their own name. These NPCs also have 5 other attributes that are included in the software.
- The 5 other attributes that are included in the software are HP, health, attack strength, speed, and weapon type. These 5 attributes are determined by random generation, user input, and booleans. 
- This software creates a simpler way to generate NPCs that is also easier to use and gives users the opportunity to influence the attributes of the NPCs.

## Overview

The software randomly generates the HP, attack strength, weapon type and speed attributes for the NPCs. The code randomly generates these 3 attributes for each of the 10 NPCs, and saves them in a dictionary so that they can be printed along with the other attributes at the end of the code. The HP is also used to determine the health of the NPCs, which is done by using a boolean to determine whether or not the HP is greater than or equal to 20. The NPC Generator can be very useful for creating traits for NPCs in video games, and still allow user input.

I'm Jayden Angulo and I am a high school student at Voorhees High School. I am interested in software development, and this is the first program that I have coded using python. I created an NPC generator because I am very passionate about video games and I wanted to improve the way that NPCs for video games are made. This NPC generator can create NPCs much faster and more efficiently than other NPC generating software.
